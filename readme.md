# FURRY GAME 

Already well known remake of Furry Game created during workshops during Coder's Lab Bootcamp, wirtten in OOP JavaScript.


This is really simple game - as a player you have to collect coins in return you get points. Once our hero - Furry - hits the edge the game ends.

## Features
This Furry Game distinguishes the concept of minimal graphic and my own Furry created in pure CSS (in front page).
